# UNO'S GAME (programmed on PHP)

This project was created as an evaluable activity for 'Desarrollo Web en Entorno Servidor' (DWESE | 'Web Development on Server Envirorment') subject as an student on my final year of DAW ('Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web' | Development of Web Applications).

As the title says, the classical game has being developed on PHP as a way to improve how to properly program on the mentioned language.
